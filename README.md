I first baked this Chocolate Truffle Cake two years ago when we were part of a neighborhood gourmet club. It was dessert for a big dinner I was serving, and it received big raves. I’ve made it so many times since then because it’s so darn incredible. And it’s a good cake to bake when you have gluten-free people in your crowd since it happens to be naturally gluten-free (there is no flour in the cake at all). With this introduction, we will now get to the interesting part- Making it!
